In a similar way in which gaze movements stabilize the orientation of the image being projected onto the retina, the pupil light response stabilizes the brightness of the image. The pupil light response is merely tasked with acting as a buffer, maintaining isoluminance for a short period, while the eye-level chemical adaptations kick in.

The statements people make about an absolute and objective reality reflect their inner beliefs as much as they reflect empirical observations. This is caused by the top-down lens through which people perceive the world, and its inevitable anthropocentric influence. If all you have is a computational paradigm, everything you see looks like an information-processing machine. However, if everything you see looks like an information-processing machine, you might have internalized a belief about the generality of computation. This connection can provide a way of tapping into inner belief structures in some forms of psychotherapy.

If a person is told that their actions are simply an effect of their neurobiology, discarding their notion of free will, then that person becomes more irresponsible. The very belief that their free will is inconsequential is influencing their behavior for the worse. This situation manifests itself indirectly in [[Self-model of consciousness mechanizes sentience|the self-model of consciousness]].

If what you learn about the world reinforces your prior beliefs, you're going to experience dopamine-driven reward. If what you learn about the world contradicts your prior beliefs, you're going to experience anxiety. One's beliefs, through their interaction with the world, influence the body's very biochemistry through the secretion of neurotransmitters, hormones, and other substances. Ignoring the philosophical elephant in the room that is the mind-body problem, this connection can provide a framework for how memetic interactions driven by one's ideological mark-up can have an influence on their actual body, nudging the body into possibly helpful physiological states.

Information about the physical space, mostly related to the immediate surroundings of the individual, but also related to imagery, appears coded in the same brain regions as concepts. This overlap of the neural substrates of spatial reasoning and conceptual thinking hints at the metaphorical projections which might provide the foundations of conceptual thought.

The tradition of symbolic AI attempted to formalize intelligence as symbol manipulation. On the other hand, connectionist AI attempted to do that through neural networks, using no explicit symbols. Empiricism, as opposed to nativism, argues that a mind has no prior knowledge about the world prior to observing it, it's tabula rasa. Deep learning can be viewed as empiricism because models are trained on data from an environment. Backpropagation appears to be biologically implausible, yet is very effective in deep learning. Humans need far fewer samples to learn from compared to deep learning models. Adversarial attacks against deep learning models appear similar to optical illusions for humans. Deep learning models inherit bias from data, which has some intriguing implications for the empiricism analogy. Philosophical normativity might be able to provide moral guidelines for building AI. DNNs are compatible with a mechanistic view on cognition.

The level of arousal influences functional brain connectivity. This influence leads to changes in the dynamics of thought. A sleepy and drowsy person is considered to have a less rigid, more fluid, and less constrained pattern of thought. Conversely, a stressed fearful person is considered to have a rigid, accurate, convential cognitive dynamic. In the context of the neural manifold hypothesis, this suggests that metabolic influences alter the manifold structure and vector field.

Even if the retinal image is flipped relative to the world outside the eye, the brain has no trouble in perceiving the world. The fact that the brain seamlessly interprets the idiosyncratic retinal image highlights its ability to mine for patterns. Retinal projection contains a clear mapping to the world, although initially non-trivial.

Statistical models of users, in the more advanced sense, can be used to inform decisions about marketing campaigns. By testing many marketing strategies against the high-fidelity user model, people can engineer highly-effective marketing campaigns on the real users. Unfortunately, publishing one's thoughts might lead to better such user models.

A machine learning model can spontaneously reach a region of the optimization space where its performance as judged by the optimization function is superb, yet its behavior with respect to its creator's intentions is deplorable. For instance, an agent in a simulated physical environment may learn to exploit a bug of the physics engine, scoring high with a meaningless strategy, because it hijacked its own reward system. Similarly, addicted individuals, together with their internal reward systems, are learning to optimize for innate drives, but don't end up manifesting meaningful behavior. Addiction arguably leads to a counterproductive behavior for the individual and society, even if performance on the dopamine optimization function is superb.

In contrast with a deeply artificial background or environment, a somewhat natural robot or virtual agent may appear life-like and natural. Context-dependent effects, such as those found in color perception, plausibly exist in the perception of naturalness and human nature. This effect might be able to rescue robots from the uncanny valley.

Levels of perceived light have been shown to inform the circadian rhythm. It seems that compounds secreted in the eye in response to light are responsible for this. Blue light appears to particularly drive chemical adaptation in the eye.

People are capable of adjusting their baseline reference point of pain and pleasure based on experience. This means that through long enough exposure to a pleasant or painful stimuli, one is going to eventually perceive it as perfectly ordinary. The notion of hedonic adaptation empowers individuals going through difficult situations.

To grasp the red apple, a robot needs to: identify the object, come up with a motor plan, and execute it. Information concerning both spatial attention and movement intention can be found in the PPC (posterior parietal cortex). Spatial attention is the way we orient our attention to a specific location in space. Spatial attention can be moved independently of any effector (e.g. hand or eyes). Movement intentions are movement plans directed to a location in space that are specific for each effector. Spatial attention consists of orienting our attention to the object location, and it's independent from the effector. Conversely, movement intention consists of planning to move to the object location, and it's specific to the effector. The Posner paradigm investigates attentional capture for spatial attention without effector movement. In the saccade task, a monkey has to memorize the flash location, and later move its eyes to that location. In the reaching task, a monkey has to memorize the flash location, and later move the hand to the target location. By comparison the saccade and reach task, we get different motor intentions, but similar same spatial attention. If PPC reflects movement intentions, we expect different activity during the two tasks, because they're effector-specific. Activity in the LIP area (Lateral Intraparietal) differs between the saccade and reach trials, with higher activity for saccade trials. LIP codes for saccade motor plans. In contrast, PRR (Parietal Reach Region) shows higher activity during reach trials, so it might code for reaching plans. Spatial attention and movement intentions can be experimentally separated in the memory task. There are separate areas in the PPC that code the specific motor plan, with LIP for saccade and PRR for reaching.

People from many cultures associate points with places and lines with connections, among others. There appears to be a systematicity to visual vocabulary across cultures, which highlights the connection between descriptive and depictive representations.

Emergent properties of a system can often be seen as approximate macrolevel descriptions of the low level. In this view, emerging symbolic representations in a neural network would be closely linked to the resonant dynamics of the network itself. In inclusive emergence, symbolic representations derived from distributed neural activity can't be properly tackled independently, contrary to what has been tried with syntax trees, for instance. A good parallel for inclusive emergence in cognition is genetic coding. In genetic coding, DNA structures do code for specific aminoacids, but only in the context of a complex distributed metabolic system which resides in the background of such symbols.

Smooth pursuit and saccades exapt parts of optokinetic nystagmus, a gaze stabilization reflex. Smooth persuit is a cognitively modulated version of the slow phase of optokinetic nystagmus. In contrast, saccades are a top-down influenced version of the fast phase.

The huge diversity of logics, including [[Modal logic proper enables possible worlds semantics|modal logic]], [[Default logic processes formalize sequential reasoning|default logic]], or [[Tense logic formalizes time|tense logic]], provide formal conceptual frameworks for describing, evaluating, and managing truth. Through domain-specific operators such as [[Tense logic formalizes time|time-related ones]], logics provide tools for reasoning about truth in certain complex situations.

This metaphor combines aspects of the brain-piano metaphor with aspects of the brain-stadium metaphor. The brain-orchestra metaphor links neural activity to the symphony produced by an orchestra. Its performance is mostly based on music notes, similar to neural spikes, yet the wide variety of instruments involved highlights the diversity of neuron cells. As in the brain-stadium metaphor, the brain-orchestra metaphor also provides some intuition for neuroimaging from outside the music hall up to an individual instrument.

The brain-train metaphor is a double metaphor. On the one hand, it relates the trajectory of neural activity with a passenger boarding a specific train of thought. On the other hand, it relates the brain structure with the rigid railway infrastructure which supports traveling. The brain-train metaphor highlights the rigid nature of brain structure, while also hinting at the possibility of switching patterns of thought by switching trains. It's important to note that the brain-train metaphor doesn't invoke structural neural pathways, but rather abstract high-dimensional connectivity which supports the aggregate functional dynamic.

Unsupervised learning is a misnomer, because often labels are derived from the data itself. Performing self-supervised learning using a huge amount of data might be one of the few feasible methods of endowing an artificial agent with robust commonsense. The reasoning is that human performance and few-shot learning is possible only with the epistemological background of commonsense acquired during development.

The rough mechanic processing of visual stimuli through eye movement is analogous to the rather primitive techniques of data preprocessing in machine learning. Both eye movement in visual perception and data preprocessing in computer vision are ways of increasing the signal to noise ratio of the stimuli.

People subconsciously attribute beneficial psychological attributes to a person who looks good. Essentially, physical appearance modules people's perception of one's psychological attributes.

Not only is a medium a channel for information to propagate through. Printing, writing, radio, TV, and other major media for information brought about significant changes in the messages being exchanged. Media aren't static support structures for unrelated messages, they mutually inform each other.

Spatial reasoning forces the individual to abstract away from features perceived through individual modalities, such as brightness and loudness, and derive an independent spatial representation. Due to this, spatial reasoning is conceptually located at the confluence of all the bodily senses.

While objectivism argues the there is such a thing as absolute truth (consonant with empiricism and realism), and subjectivism argues that truth is only a matter of personal interpretation (consonant with romanticism and idealism), Lakoff and Johnson suggest a third approach. Experientialism argues that there can be a shared agreed-upon truth which provides enough grounding for functional development and interaction, but which is itself based on one's embodiment and cultural embedding. Lakoff and Johnson argue that truth is as much the product of an outer world as it is one of an inner experiential world, without falling into either one of these two extremes. In this view, the subjectivism-objectivism dichotomy appears to be nothing more than a counterproductive meme.

Individuals are more than a list of attributes encoded in their genome. Changes in a phenotypic trait are most often associated with a coordinated non-linear change in multiple genes. It is rare that one isolated gene codes for a specific trait.

Conflicting beliefs trigger cognitive dissonance, a deeply-rooted unpleasant feeling. The consuming conflict can spark anxiety, which manifests vividly from the cognitive to the behavioral domain. Therefore, the spontaneous anxious response can be seen as a sparse signal into one's ideological structures. This signal can inform a number of cognitive-based psychotherapies.

In the spirit of constructivism, one should strive for finding connections between newly acquired knowledge and previous knowledge through the closest semantic distances. By focusing on leveraging the highest semantic similarities, one is optimally internalizing new knowledge by using existing knowledge as a scaffolding structure.

If we perceive the world around as and derive representations from it, as the cognitive realist might argue, and if we can imagine looking at the world from an arbitrary perspective, then why does our awareness default to first-person view? This is a dilemma explored by Greg Egan in "Seeing Through". Why is it that we don't have access to a vivid third-person view, based on the same (imperfect) representations?

The traditional spaced repetition paradigm treats items or flashcards as independent units which have to be approached and learned individually. However, the human mind arguably contains no clear-cut distinctions between such items and deeply integrates them in an interconnected web of knowledge. Therefore, spaced repetition systems could integrate notions of semantic relatedness between the items being learned, leading to a new paradigm of sense repetition.

One might assume that the drive for reducing cognitive dissonance is strong and innate. Just like the body's very wiring for preventing physical pain, the brain might prove very resourceful in reducing cognitive dissonance. However, the mind and brain also have an influence over the body proper, through neurotransmitters, hormones, and other biochemical and nervous interactions. That said, it's plausible to assume that a belief of good health might actually have a say in one's good health due to the body being wired to make our worldview coherent. If incoherence between world and worldview is painful, and if the brain can modulate (a part of) the world (the body proper), then it's plausbile that it will do it to some extent.

The von Neumann architecture marks a clear distinction between memory and computation. This, however, leads to the von Neumann bottleneck, because information has to continuously be brought back and forth between memory components and computational compontents. In contrast, neural networks merge memory and computation by design. Their parameters house predefined representations, yet inference enables then to support computation.

If a knowledge base is based on textual representation of knowledge, then natural language processing can render it into an agent. By providing a conversational interface to the knowledge base, natural language processing can be used to "put a face on" arbitrary collections of text, such as working notes, books of an author, or news reports.

Cognitive realism argues that a large part of cognition is about forming and manipulating coherent representations of the "outside" world in an attempt to best navigate it. Conversely, idealism argues that it is only our representations that we have access to, so they must be our only reference points. In the extreme, idealism holds that even the notion of an "outside" world is an internal representation.

In a Feynman cluster, free learners from widely different disciplines can come together and teach each other about key insights, nuggets, and findings they encountered recently. Due to the widely different backgrounds involved in a Feynman cluster, teaching is similar to practicing the Feynman technique, but in a more social context. The Feynman cluster gives rise positive-sum situation between learners and teachers, because they both have something to gain: new knowledge and better understanding, respectively. Besides enabling the positive-sum loop, social structure can also make the Feynman technique more enjoyable and accountable.

Because [[Cognitive augmentation is morally ambiguous when qualitatively novel|restoring a lost ability feels more reasonable than adding a qualitatively different ability to a person's mind]], cognitive decline provides a motivating context for cognitive enhancement across a wide range of cognitive domains. From memory to perception, cognitive decline is based on the loss of something which was previously there, by definition, so it provides ample moral opportunity for developing means of cognitive augmentation.

Piotr Wozniak argues that good learning is inherently pleasurable. He argues that people have an innate drive for learning, innately associated with reward systems. This is consonant with the view of the human as an infovore, wired from birth to accumulate knowledge.

Jackendoff argues that awareness is losely connected to an objective world in that it is informed by it. However, he argues that awareness is also only losely connected to a subjective world of thought, in that we're often not aware of our thought process, or at least part of it. In doing so, Jackendoff creates a somewhat enactive alternative approach to the subject-object dichotomy.

Based on load, the brain predictibly recruits otherwise unrelated regions in certain cognitive tasks, a phenomenon also known as compensatory scaffolding. When processing load resumes to manageable levels, the spontaneous increase of allocated resources reverts. This resembles variable allocation of computational resources in web apps with unpredictible user traffic, such as in cloud services. However, just like for a string, there's still a strong upper limit approached asymptotically.

Cartesian anxiety refers to the incessant human craving for an absolute ground, an absolute reference point with respect to which they can predictably operate. This search for an objective "outside" world is reflected in the ideal of mind as a mirror of nature. Through cognitive dissonance, Cartesian anxiety discourages one from considering any belief structure which is at odds with objectivism and the sense of the world as an absolute ground.

Boids are a surpisingly simple, yet effective, computational model of crowd movement. By guiding individual movements of agents through a linear combination of several "drives", boids achieve crowd-like movement. The rules which guide boids are: separation (avoid crowded neighborhoods), alignment (align with nearby agents), and cohesion (aim for the centroid).

The development of commonsense can be viewed as the creation and polishing of causal models about the world. Causal models enable an intuitive understanding of many different domains of one's life. For instance, intuitive physics provides us with basic understanding about physical objects, movement, forces, and so on. Intuitive sociology gives us a basic sense of groups, families, collectives, us and them. Intuitive morality gives us a basic understanding of good and bad, likely formed through associations with physical experience, namely pain and pleasure.

Limbic friction is a concept introduced by Andrew Huberman which refers to the routine conflict between low-level instinctive drives manifested in subcortical areas and high-level reflexive drives manifested in the neocortex. Even though this notion unquestioningly subscribes to the anatomical dichotomy of cortical/subcortical being superimposed on cognitive function, it successfully highlights the demanding conflict between goals at those different levels. Moreover, it seems like systematically rewarding top-down effort helps develop endurance to limbic friction.

The two conflicting movements which characterize the pupil are guided by different nervous systems. Pupil dilation is associated with high arousal, and is directed by the sympathetic nervous system. In contrast, pupil constriction is associated with low arousal, and is directed by the parasympathetic nervous system. Those movements, and likely the larger networks which contain them, are antagonistic.

There's more to an interface than a physical boundary between two agents interacting. A space can also act as an interface between an agent and a community (e.g. stadium), between an agent and a behavior (e.g. kitchen), or between an agent and a thought (e.g. library). Architecture expands interaction beyond the narrow view of human-computer interaction.

Contrary to strong views of cognitive realism, perception across a wide range of modalities seems to be tightly linked to the experiential context. Sounds influence vision perception. Color guides perception of shapes. Top-down memory provides a lens through which we view the world. Perception doesn't seem to be a process of recovering physical properties of the environment, but rather a complex experiential emergence.

The perception of movement through space can decrease the level of bodily stress one experiences. If autonomic arousal was evolutionarily engineered to "get us moving", then it only make sense for movement to bring stress levels down, essentially signaling that stress was already effective. Therapeutic practices like EMDR exploit this optic flow destressor by asking participants to incessantly move their eyes horizontally, left to right, while working through a traumatic event, for instance. EMDR exapts the optic flow destressing mechanism.

The grandmother cell hypothesis argues that there are cortical neurons which selectively code single specific concepts, such as one's grandmother. Those gnostic neurons seem to code abstract concepts all by themselves, and respond robustly to variations of that same concept. The grandmother cell hypothesis is a perspective of extreme sparsity, compared to views of more interconnected and distributed representations.

Cognitive magnification takes place across all modalities. The somatosensory "homonculus" is highly distorted, leading to a non-linear representation of the body. The retinotopic organization of the early visual cortex regions distorts the representation of the visual field. This is also reflected in the systematically distorted drawings of childredn around the world. However, the conscious awareness of this distortion is limited. Still, this non-linearity can be an innate mechanism enabling intricate non-linear manifold structures to be derived in neural space.

Scarcity makes things appear more valuable than they would in abundance. This tendency can be applied in the context of practicing gratitude. By making the scarcity of individual experiences more salient, one can perceive them as more valuable, and in turn cultivate gratitude towards them.

Older adults appear to use sparser, more distributed networks for the same tasks as their younger counterparts. This suggests that the elder brain attempts to compensate more for cognitive decline by recruiting additional brain regions in its activity. Specifically, they often seem to recruit frontal regions for otherwise "occipital" tasks, plausibly due to increased difficulty of perceiving sensations from decayed eyes. However, this effect could also be simply a result of neurons becoming less specialized with age in terms of their receptive fields. This adaptation suggests that ageing is an active process involving neurplasticity.

Computer networking is a prime source of mental models describing social organization, cooperation, collaboration, competition, and so on. This is due to the fact that it is driven by human incentives like trust and privacy, yet it operates mostly on a purely abstract and programmatic level, which enables creativity in exploring various social models. WPA handshakes, firewalls, demilitarized zones, all provide idealized mental models of social design. This might also mean that computer networking can inform social dreaming and vice versa.

Genetics can be seen as an evolution of evolution, in that it's a mechanism for persisting "solutions" to difficult evolutionary "problems" across generations so that new generations don't have to constantly reinvent the wheel of thriving in an ecology. However, junk DNA has been observed to also carry meaningless information, challenging this hard adaptationist take. Kurzweil likens the scientific body of knowledge as a genome of technology, supporting incremental development from generation to generation.

The relative position of an object can be coded in various coordinate frames, such as relative to the eyes or the body. Reaching plans seem coded in eye coordinates because they appear relative to the eye fixation position. When moving the eye fixation, reaching plans change in coding. When moving the initial hand location, reaching plans don't change. PRR neurons code for the position of the target of the reaching movement in eye coordinates. Remapping consists of changing object location representation based on changed eye attending location. In the intervening saccade task, the monkey has to move her eyes while keeping track of the target location. Neurons whose receptive fields cover the target after the intervening sacade start firing for remapping. Visual targets of reaching movements are coded in eye coordinates. If we locate the object in eye coordinates, then how do we actually grasp it? The first hypothesis claims that info in eye coordinates is translated to head coordinates, body coordinates, and hand coordinates. The second hypothesis claims that all body shape information gets combined in one go. The third hypothesis claims that info in eye coordinates is directly translated to hand coordinates. By probing neurons involved in movement intention we can predict future movements before they occur and use this in building brain-computer interfaces. The reason why PPC is probed in BCI's, instead of the motor cortex, is it codes intentions and high-level planning of a subject, which are a more useful basis for robotic movement. The intervening saccade task shows that the activity in PRR shifted to update the target location in light of new eye position. Three different models propose different ways for how info in eye coordinates gets translated to hand coordinates for reaching.

If you wanted to get a new suit, you might order a custom suit tailored to your specific body size, dimensions, etc. However, this is costly, and another possibility would be to simply go out and chose an existing models among a few. Adaptationism argues that individuals evolve to get an optimal fit on their environment, just like the custom suit approach. However, selectionism argues that individuals evolve by making "smart" choices, essentially choosing what works for them more losely, or "satisficing".

Contrastive learning is essentially machine learning based on strategically sampling counterexamples for a given concept. Similarly, some sociologists argue that criminality and deviant behavior is essential for a well-functioning society because it provides "counterexamples" to the norm. Essentially, deviants successfully inform the social norm space, perhaps better than actual explicit norms. Their expressiveness is essential, as without them society would lose a sense of definition, there would be a collapse, like in machine learning.

In the brain-stadium metaphor, neural activity is associated with the vivid activity which happens inside a stadium during a sport event. Each individual supporter from the audience represents a neuron firing. According to this mapping, EEG corresponds to recording sound from outside the stadium, trying to reconstruct individual supporter activity. Additionally, single unit recording corresponds to having microphones down the throats of individual supporters.

Agitation and stress are closely linked to autonomic arousal, an innate drive for taking action. Therefore, if used wisely, stress can be a central psychological resource which propels you towards difficult goals. However, it's important to choose self-regulatory and self-induced sources of stress which are pressing, yet tactful, such as deadlines or public commitments.

Both spiders and chickens, across other animals, have different photoreceptor configurations across different eyes. They essentially split bottom-up processing at a very early level, having different eyes specialized in extracting various features.

When considering a space with an extremely high number of dimensions, it might suffice to selectively sample from a subset of dimensions for defining an expressive manifold. The resulting dimensionality of the manifold wouldn't match the one caused by selective sampling, but it would be even lower. An instance of this might be feasible in neural interfaces, where reading from a subset of critical neurons might bring advanced imaging into our technological reach, as argued by Greg Egan in his short story titled "Learning To Be Me".

One intuitively conceives creativity as the process of creation. However, creativity can also be seen as the process of intuitively ignoring the multitude of possible ways to go, and wisely choosing one path forward. The painter eventually painted one painting, not a billion other possible ones. The sculptor carved the block of stone in this particular way, not in one of the alternative myriad of ways. Creativity is fundamentally a search process, a foraging process. This is especially clear in machine-based creativity.

In guided search, people are said to make use of pre-attentive low-level features in their search for a more complex item. Essentially, guidance based on a somewhat parallel pre-attentive search provides a preliminary filtering mechanism. Similarly, in semantic search and other machine learning tasks, progressively more complex models are employed to sequentially tread through the items involved.

Many people use a buffer for developing a second brain in the form of a light-weight setup for taking transient notes. Later, one makes the effort of synthetizing more durable entries based on those notes. In a fascinating (yet grossly superficial) perspective, the buffer for fleeting notes can be seen as the hypocampus of the second brain, the locus of a short-term memory system.

Both artificial and biological neurons appear to develop receptive fields which span multiple modalities if initially exposed to multi-modal data. In such contexts, it doesn't seem like neurons specialize in responding to individual modalities, likely due to the mutually-informing dimensions of the data itself. This further suggests that cognitive processes are not conducted in isolation, but in a deep interconnected fashion from which an abstract conceptual understanding emerges.

In the motor "homonculus", the size of the regions associated with various body parts is not proportional to the physical size of those body parts. Instead, the motor cortex seems to perform cognitive magnification for function, instead of structure. This premotor orientation supports the action-oriented enactive view of cognition.

9/11 was cause by lax controls in freedom of movement for people. Consonant with Herbert Schiller's critique of freedom of information, a memetic equivalent of the 9/11 might occur in the future, due to the lax norms of information hygiene. Malevolently-engineered memes may be able to propagate like wildfire in the global informational society of the modern age.

Free learning communities are based on validation through creation. Individuals are forced to generate creative output in order to obtain credibility, validation, and financial support. However, creative output which is educational in nature can be piped back into the free learning community as educational content, essentially closing the loop. There is great value in distilling material and creating great educational resources, and an appropriate culture around this might render free learning communities self-sustainable.

Backlinks are incoming connections from other nodes to the current node being made visible. Besides highlighting associations between notes in non-linear not-taking, backlinks could provide a means of collaborative knowledge work. By presenting interpersonal backlinks (backlinks caused by a person linking one of their notes to a note from a different person), one can encourage a dense network of collective knowledge. By introducing a node ranking method, such as PageRank, one could incentivize knowledge workers to produce the valuable content.

In his short story titled Axiomatic, Greg Egan introduces the notion of axiomatic implants. Axiomatic implants are speculative devices capable of inoculating the user with certain beliefs. They target address beliefs, and have a specific duration of activation.

The brain-building metaphor is focused on the distinction between structure and function. According to this metaphor, brain structure corresponds to the building structure. Additionally, in a similar way a building structure supports various social functions (e.g. work, leisure, etc.), the brain structure supports various cognitive functions (e.g. hope, act, etc.). On a related note, it is the architecture which connects the structure and the function, both for the building and the brain. This idea gave rise to the notion of cognitive architectures.

In extremely painful situation, physically or psychologically, people often develop apathy, an effective numbing of their emotional response to the world. [[Hedonic adaptation makes individuals versatile|This defensive mechanism related to hedonic adaptation can be seen as an often needed protective shield.]]

Tense logic is a modal logic with four modal operators related to past and future. However, the modal operators of tense logic are perfectly defined in terms of accessibility relations. Time flow direction is based on which world accesses which other world. In tense logic, the accessibility relation stands for "earlier than", meaning that only past worlds can access future worlds.

If a patient internalizes a set of beliefs during memetic psychotherapy and then her actions are influenced by it, then is she completely responsible for her actions? Or is the therapist responsible for her actions? Or is the computational component involved in computer-aided rationalization? Additionally memetic psychotherapy may provide a painkiller for cognitive dissonance. Will this cause addiction? In this sense, memetic psychotherapy is morally ambiguous, yet insights from contemporary therapy might resolve this ambiguity.

Cognitivism is considered to lead to two counterintuitive consequences in the experiential domain. First, it postulates that there are mechanisms of the mind which are inaccessible to conscious awareness. Not only are they said to be unconscious, but they're said to be impossible to bring into conscious awareness. Second, cognitivism postulates that the mind consists of fragmented modules, operating one with each other. In doing this, it challenges the experiential conviction of the unity of the self, and builds up a picture of the fragmented self. [[Beliefs are gates into the body's biochemistry|Those postulates of cognitivism could plausibly have experiential consequences for the researchers who internalize them.]]

It has been observed that high-level cognition modulates pupil size. Particularly fascinating is the way in which visual imagery influences pupil size. Visualizing a (relatively) bright object or scene appears to actually lead to a physiological response in the eye, where the pupils constrict. Similarly, visualizing a dark scene nudges the pupils into dilating more.

In the concept-room metaphor, concept are associated with rooms in a family house. Exemplars are associated with physical objects stored in those rooms. In this metaphor, exemplars naturally "belong together" in a certain room. For instance, cooking utensils belong in the kichen and cleaning supplies belong in the bathroom.

Phenomenological transparency refers to the experience of a tool being part of your body. Drivers extend their situational awareness to that of their car. Phenomeneological transparency and the mechanisms which presumably support it might be the foundation of affordances. With a strong enactive and premotor attitude, one could envision a phenomenological theory of affordances which might integrate with James Gibson's model.

Sometimes, the presence of too many possible solutions is a problem in itself, because many of them have to be investigated. This is precisely why search algorithms are difficult to engineer: it's difficult to tell which solutions aren't promising from the start.

Just like a hammer can mediate one's interaction with a nail, up to the point that the hammer is perceived as if it's part of one's body, so can a tool for thought mediate one's interaction with knowledge. Tools for thought provide an interface for interacting with representations. Through the affordances they create, they might also lead to phenomenological transparency.

Just like people possess two kidneys, and can live even if one is damaged, so can a neural emulation provide a bodily redundance for the brain. This argument is explored at length in Greg Egan's short story "Learning To Be Me".

Space agencies thoroughly disinfect the spacecraft in fear of not brining microbes over to extraterrestrial biomes with devastating consequences. This is likely do in response to the ignorant behavior of European explorers on American land who brought harmful microbes and disease, having devastating effect on the indigeneous population. However, the same is happening unwillingly with memes, as global communication platforms enable the selection of memes unbound by geographies.

Our brains change from day to day. Sleep, experiences, learning, and many other processes influence our brains and arguably also minds. One might argue that a neural emulation which achieves an error rate below the natural baseline of deviation in human life is an sufficiently "accurate" one to be deployed. This is losely related to how self-driving cars are considered safe when they are at least as safe as human drivers. However, one could also very well argue that it's in this unpredictible error in which the human nature resides. This conflicts has been shortly explored in Greg Egan's short story, "Learning To Be Me".

There is a sensible parallel to be made between momentum in stochastic optimization and retrospective futurism. In machine learning, some families of optimizers, including the popular Adam optimizer, incorporate a dynamic of momentum. Specifically, momentum guides the current direction of optimization using the recent history of movement on the loss surface. Similarly, retrospective futurism attempts to look back at the past developments of a trend in order to better forecast its future development.

Carbon shovinism argues that only carbon-based life forms, such as human, can possess real intelligence. This position argues that artificial general intelligence can never manifest. However, it could be countered through an appeal to inclusiveness.

The Doctrine of Double Effect argues that causing harm as an intended side effect is more permissible than causing harm as a primary goal. This framework allows one to coherently accept self-driving cars occasionally resulting causing casualties, while simultaneously rejecting autonomous weapons designed specifically to kill.

If agitation evolved to get us moving, and if moving stops agitation from building up, such as with optic flow, then finally picking up an important but much delayed task might decrease stress. It might signal the body that the goal of the agitation build-up has been reached, and that there's no need for more.

Soundness refers to whether all inferences proved by a proof system are actually valid. Completeness refers to whether all valid inferences are provable through a proof system.

Family resemblance is the set of implicit dimensions which glue together the members of a representational family. Family resemblance stitches together fuzzy borders of fuzzy concepts. It creates gradients of membership in the latent space with continuous truth values. Originally applied to what brings together members of a family, family resemblance can elegantly extend beyond facial features.

How widespread a species is, specifically with respect to other species in its ecological niche, might be indicative of high fitness. A population which mastered its environment, through metabolic, reproductive, and security  lens, is likely to be abundant in a given ecological niche. However, this time-bound inference is lacking if one considers long-tail existential risks. Abundance should be taken into consideration together with perseverence.

Social media platforms have been criticized for their collection of data through face recognition of people who don't even hold accounts on these platforms. This malicious attempt against privacy was based on the data provided by actual users, which did have accoutns on the platforms. Similarly, when neuroimaging matures, it might become feasible to reconstruct aspects of an individual which hasn't been scanned from the knowledge and memories of individuals which have been scanned. This intriguing notion is explored in depth in Greg Egan's "A Kidnapping".

If a species has been around for a long while, it's likely not only it is going to continue being around for a long while, but that it also possesses some sort of optimal fit on its environment. Assuming that it is ecological fitness that enables a species to survive through long-tail existential catastrophes, perseverence is a strong indicator of fitness. However, to get a more complete picture of fitness, one should take both the time-wise perseverence and space-wise abundance into account.

The premotor theory of attention argues that covert attention is actually a motor plan being prepared. This action-oriented cognition is deeply compatible with the enactive view in cognitive science. The premotor theory of attention frames a high-level cognitive function in relation to a low-level motor coupling.

The most frequent words denoting colors consistently encompass the entire perceptual color space across languages. The phonemes employed by the speakers of a language are consistently spread out over the entire articulatory space. This systematic diffusion might be caused by the increased value of symbolic discriminability and between-subject categorical consistency. Regularization constraints are often intentionally engineered into machine learning models, such as in variational autoencoders, in order to force representations to uniformly span the latent space.

Pupil size has traditionally been seen as a low-level reflex in response to light. However, it turns out that a wide range of high-level cognitive factors can modulate the changes in pupil size. Among those factors are cognitive load and visual imagery.

If you can't actually prove or disprove that another human individual is sentient, then why would it be possible to prove or disprove the sentience of a neural emulation. Specifically, if we take other human individuals as being sentient, why wouldn't we also consider emulations sentient if they don't provide less evidence.

If one wants to design useful affordances for users through tools for thought, one has to be aware of the technological capabilities underlying those tools. Learning about machine learning helps tools for thought developers realize which functionalities are feasible and which aren't.

By using fluid search through a collection of previous notes, one can elevate into their awareness the most semantically related items in their second brain. This way, they are then easily able to optimally weave together new information with old information, in the spirit of constructivism.

Breathing can be used as a conscious control for influencing the body stress level. By performing deep breathing, one is maximizing the blood oxygen saturation while eliminating most of the carbon dioxide. The body reacts to this highly favorable situation by relaxing on a biochemical level. Conversely, one can hold their breath, and in doing so cause temporary hypoxia, a situation in which cells can't eliminate carbon dioxide and can't replenish their oxygen supply. This leads to an increase in stress on a biochemical level, and by extension to a state of high autonomic arousal.

Sociologists agree on the fact that public opinion is formed in time, not instantly in reaction to an event. For instance, a rough heuristic for when to start doing surveys is one week after an event. Similarly, there is also a suggested time point which marks a decrease in relevance, suggested at 3 weeks after the event as a guideline. Those oddly specific time points can be seen as specifying propagation dynamics of memes, perhaps being spawned in a memetic ecosystem and then being assimilated or rendered extinct.

The basilar membrane in the ear actively adapts sensitivity to certain frequency. The pupil actively changes in size in expectation to certain brightness levels. Adaptive physiology across modalities reflects top-down cognitive processes.

A simple way to force a machine learning model to derive a meaningful representation about the world it lives in is by tasking it to predict the short-term future. If a model successfully manages to predict how its environment unfolds in the future, then it plausibly learned a great deal about its inner workings.

The self-model of consciousness argues that consciousness is simply a useful mental model for understanding our relation to the world. Supporters of this perspective, including Joscha Bach, Peter Watts, and Greg Egan, argue that free will is simply an afterthought of behavior, designed to infuse our worldview with coherence. This reduction of the self as a mental model is representative of the mechanistic and cognitivist school of thought in cognitive science. This perspective is likely to [[Experiential consequences of cognitivism|have experiential consequences for its proponents]], especially [[Denying free will is morally debilitating|regarding morality]].

Discrete items, such as words, being embedded in a semantic space can be seen as individual checker pieces. The relative arrangement of those items is particularly important, and it's reflected in the configuration of the checker board containing the individual pieces. This embedding-checkers metaphor provides a tangible way of reasoning about how the meaning of items in a latent space is derived mainly through their relative arrangement.

Misogi are extremely difficult tasks one is undertaking. By systematically exposing oneself to harsh challenges, and sometimes managing to overcome them, one can expand their conception of what's possible. Essentially, Misogi is a tool for radically modifying the affordances of the world as perceived by an individual.

The brain can be likened to an ocean. On the surface of the ocean, there are waves which reflect the aggregate activity of the deeper ocean currents in some non-linear way. The waves correspond to the surface activity of the brain, in that they vaguely reflect the underlying neural activity. Moreover, the depths of the ocean can be linked to subcortical brain structures. Those structures are difficult to observe from the outside, and one needs to perform a deep dive in order to get meaningful readings. Moreover, EEG experiments are all about systematically dropping droplets into the ocean surface and studying how the dynamics change. Unfortunately, it's difficult to pick up the droplet-related signal from the chaotic noise of the waves.

If a machine learning model has been trained to predict the short-term future of an environment, then the model can be used to generate training data for an agent-based reinforcement learning model. This way, predictive world models can essentially turn compute into data.

People tend to unquestioningly identify with a sense of self which they have to continuously protect and foster. In this view, external events, objects, and peers are seen through the lens of alignment with the self. Day-to-day things derive meaning from their relation to one's hopes, goals, fears, and so on. However, the sense of a unitary self appears at odds with the sense of transient experience.

In the West, freedom refers to the ability to do anything one desires. Interestingly enough, the Buddhist conception of freedom starkly contradicts the Western perspective because desires are seen as behaviorally-induced shackles in the context of the self. In the Buddhist view, freedom refers to the ability of being mindful of the ego and immune to the behavioral drives it spawns.

In Cartesian and cognitive realism, the ideal of the mind is to be a mirror of nature. This coherence between the subject and the object would presumably lead to one being "in touch with reality". However, the apparent lack of direct access to the "outer world" leaves one only with their internal representations, as expressed in idealism. The actual ideal of mind as a mirror of nature leads to what can be described as Cartesian anxiety.

Bees see ultraviolet and plants are distinguishable in ultraviolet, which one came the first? Natural drift theory argues that entire ecologies evolve through a tight structural coupling, an intimate codetermination process, involving multiple entities at multiple levels of abstraction. Through satisficing in selectionism, various ragged evolutionary trajectories mutually inform each other in a recurrent fashion.

The brain-sled metaphor is conceptually similar to the brain-train metaphor. It associates thought patterns with paths a sled takes on a snowy hill. If a snow path has been followed repeatedly, it develops a form of attraction or magnetism, because of the snow trail which is differentially smooth. Similarly, thought patterns which have been followerd repeatedly are hard to break out of, because of the differentially luring trail in mental space. The abstract brain structure corresponds to the snowy hill itself and its trails.

The 2AFC paradigm (two-alternative forced choice) is very effective in psychology. By manipulating the signal-to-noise ratio in a 2AFC experiment, researchers noticed that psychometric curves are not linear. NCC (neural correlates of consciousness) are brain regions which appear to modulate consciousness. In a 2AFC, neural activity is influenced by whether you notice the signal, not only based on the presence of the signal. The locations of NCC's make it seem that consciousness and attention share brain regions. Due to the high correlation between attended stimuli and consciously reported stimuli, some think that consciousness and attention are the same function. Through contextual modelation, it has been observed that early receptive fields which don't cover the stimulus are actually later influenced in terms of activity by context. Contextual modulation appears non-existing without awareness, when monkeys didn't notice the stimuli. There seem to be opposite results, contextual modulation studies report NCC's in V1, while 2AFC studies report NCC's in the frontoparietal network. All contemporary models postulate that consciousness is the result of complex brain activity. Interactions between different brain areas are believed to be essential.

Just as a neuron involved in vision fires selectively in response to a certain kind of feature in a certain part of the visual field, a neuron involved in motor action also fires selectively when carrying out a certain movement towards a specific direction. A neuron involved in motor action can be said to have a motor field, just as a neuron involved in visual perception can be said to have a receptive field.

Danaher argues that people have an innate social desire for retribution in the event of morally harmful actions. This is likely caused by our tendency to attach "agency" to otherwise inanimate objects and use them as objects of attribution. Additionally, punishment and blame is pervasive across cultures and proportional to wrongdoing and blameworthiness. This state of affair arguably makes the problem of autonomous robots frustrating, because there's no clear retributive response. Danaher captures this frustration in what he calls the retribution gap.

In videography, B-rolls are short stock clips which are inserted during narration. Besides making narration more dynamic through different movements than the person talking, B-rolls can also diffuse the viewer's attention, making them go back and forth between a focused and a diffused mental state.

Contrary to what adaptationism would predict, evolution is not a gradual change of traits in an optimization process, but is punctuated with sudden discontinuities. This is consonant with pleiotropy, in that it highlights the internal constraints of an organism guiding its own evolutionary trajectory. It's not trivial to move out of local optima in evolution, and it requires a coordinated and unlikely choreography of changes across multiple domains. However, those unlikely shifts correspond to the observed discontinuities in evolution.

Researchers often conduct double-blind trials in order to limit the influence of their own biases on the experimental results. By being unaware of which condition is test and which one is control, researchers have no ground for exploiting biases. Similarly, removing features such as gender, race, and ethnicity from a dataset provides one less opportunity for machine learning models to capitalize on bias.

It's easier to argue for enabling someone in a way in which they where previously able, but somehow got disabled. For instance, restoring sight to a person who lost their sight seems intuitive and morally unambiguous. However, extending the mind with an entirely new sense seems somewhat more ambiguous.

Gaining mechanistic understanding requires knowledge about causality. Science aims to distinguish genuine causes from spurious correlations. Hume argued that empiricism can't consider causation at all. Logic positivism argues that logic is the only source of knowledge, while empiricism argues that observation is the only one. As causality is not observable, empiricists were skeptical about causation. Correlation made the study of causation slightly more tangible, due to Galton. Correlation is problematic, as the causal relation might go either way, or some other way entirely. Causal structures explain correlation, and correlation can provide evidence for causation. The causal structure explains why changing the barometer reading can't prevent storms. Interventionism attempts to distinguish correlation from causation by systematic manipulations in experiments. The introduction of interventionism was termed the "Causal Revolution." Causal relationships can be represented with structural graphical models. Based on some rules, causal models can shed light on causal relationships. The Ladder of Causation goes as follows: association (related to correlation), intervention (related to systematic manipulation), and counterfactuals (related to falsifiability). Pearl argues that causal models are required in order to answer counterfactuals. He argues that AI is stuch on the first step of the ladder of causation, namely association. In science, deep learning appears to be good at pattern detection, yet not that good at formulating theories or causal models. Darwin's causal explanation of the origin of species is a significant example of causal models. Judea Pearl argues that we need to teach AI cause and effect. Advances in AI leads to many important philosophical questions.

In non-monotonic logics, conclusions don't have to be undeniable. They can be expressed as tentative and deafisible, meaning that it might be helpful to get to them, although they could later be invalidated.

The brain-piano metaphor highlights the nature of spiking neurons. By mapping an individual neuron to an individual key on the piano, one can then think of aggregate neural activity as a song played on the piano. Each key press corresponds to the spike of a specific neuron. Additionally, there's some rhythmicity to both the brain and the piano. Rhythicity shows up in the brain as periodic waves and on the piano as rhythm signatures.

In his short story titled "Safe-deposit Box", Greg Egan portrays an individual undergoing a progressive decay of brain tissue. The story describes how his consciousness, in a resourceful attempt to persist, manages to unconsciously negotiate time spent in the bodies of other individuals. The "Safe-deposit Box" depicts an extreme case of phychological resilience through an individual whose consciousness jumps regularly from individual to individual around his body.

Given unlabeled data, one can create training samples from it by partially corrupting it and tasking a model with restoring it. This has recently been done in natural language processing with BERT. However, the same approach is present in denoising autoencoders for computer vision. Additionally, given unlabeled data, one can also create training samples by extracting meaningful pairs of snippets from one initial data point or two different ones, and minimizing a triplet loss. This matching procedure is present in the joint-embedding architecture with Siamese networks, like in face recognition.

Besides implying the existence of a physical self independent of an absolute ground, the interoception-exteroception distinction highlights the conflicting nature of perceiving the body and the environment. The saliency of one of them modulates the resources deployet to the other. The control of this "budget" is influenced by the quality of sleep.

The Edward argument talks about a scientist interested in locating the sense of hearing in a spider, who after removing its legs concludes that it's located in there. There seems to be a close connection between correlation/causation, necessity/sufficiency, and constraints. Reporting guidelines for participants may be a confounding variable in consciousness studies. Blindsight patients make it tricky to define the border between evidence for conscious and unconscious processing, like in forced choice guessing. Lamme argues that introspection is an unreliable indicator of consciousness. Asking for overt responses biases attention. Social alignment biases responses in 2AFC experiments. Attention modulates consciousness, but is an independent process. Attention is not required for visual awareness.

The Lindy effect is a heuristic for predicting the lifespan of a trend based on the elapsed time of that trained at the time of prediction. The Lindy effect feels especially powerful when comparing extremes like news articles and classic literature. However, if adopting a memetic lens, one might speculate that memes become pervasive and enduring because of a host of reasons which are imperfectly aligned with normative values. The memetic take on the Lindy effect might encourage doubting and reflection of the value of long-lived memes. In the extreme view, one might be strongly deterred from internalizing enduring memes, in fear of becoming bound to a local memetic optimum.

In modal logics, the meaning of a sentence does not only depend on the current situation. Modal operators are like the universal and existential quantifiers. Modal logic proper, tense logic, deontic logic, provability logic, and epistemic logic are all examples of modal logic. Modal logic proper introduces two modal operators: necessity and possibility. The box stands for necessity, and the diamond stands for possibility. Leibniz defined possible worlds as ways the world could be. Kripke's key idea was to introduce relative possibility (the possibility relative to a possible world) through the accessibility relation. Propositional atoms have different values in different worlds. Informally, the accessibility relation determines whether a world is possible relative to a different world. In modal logic proper, the valuation function requires not only a formula but also the world. A Kripke model consists of a triple . Inductive truth definitions are very similar for modal logic proper compared to propositional logic if you only consider one world. A formula is possible in a world if and only if there is another world accessible from it where the formula is true. A formula is necessary in a world if and only if it's true in all accessible worlds. Validity requires designated values for all models and all their worlds at once.

Temporal attention is analogous to spatial attention. Spatial cues can prime participants in attending to a certain location in space. Conversely, temporal cues can prime participants in attenting to stimuli occuring at certain moments in time. Rhythm is a temporal cue which guides the deployment of attentional resources at regular intervals. Expectation priming also influences attention deployment through increased sampling frequency and earlier onset. Spatial cue-like temporal cues also bias attention. Attentional blink refers to an attentional blindspot a little after initial deployment. Spatial and temporal attention are based on different brain regions and mechanism, even though they interact.

Mindfulness meditation can be seen as the exercise of recognizing intentions and desires which are derived from one's belief in the existence of the self. Buddhist practitioners argue that it is only by breaking the automatic chain of reaction which originates from the belief of self that one can become wise and free. This perspective is encoded in the Buddhist Wheel of Life, or samsara, which represents a continuous cycle which goes repeatedly from self to intention across a complex trajectory.

More often than not, a machine learning model can learn to solve a given task in an unexpected way. By definition, machine learning addresses problem for which people can't explicitly articulate a powerful solution themselves, so this is understandable. However, those perverse instantiations, as Bostrom calls them, can be deeply misaligned with the creator's interests. For instance, tasked with getting to a destination faster, a self-driving car successfully gets there with some police helicopters on its tail.

Several variations can be derived from modal logic proper by enforcing additional constraints. The reflexive restriction enforces reflexive relationship for all possible worlds. The symmetry restriction enforces reciprocal or mutual relations between worlds. The transitivity restriction is self-explanatory. The extendability restriction means that there's always some world you can go to, there are no dead end worlds. Validity in restricted normal modal logics are obtained by taking into consideration the specific dynamics of truth preservation. In the tableaux, the restrictions intuitively apply as inferences on the relations themselves.

Saccades often exhibit curvature. Consonant with the premotor theory of attention, modulating covert premotor attention influences the subsequent saccade trajectory. This saccade curvature can be induced through distractors. This finding is compatible with the model of attention itself as being based on a salience map. Eye movement would seek to navigate towards a salience optimum, while being nudged along the way.

In software development related to augmented reality, cloud anchors are textual identifiers for places in space. By using cloud anchors, developers can engineer AR apps which enable shared experiences with multiple users. Just like cloud anchors provide an identifier for a certain scene, place cells in the brain code for a certain place. The metaphor between cloud anchors and place cells bridges software engineering and cognitive neuroscience.

If a community of free learners or knowledge workers constantly produces creative output in the form of notes, then a conversational interface based on natural language processing can wrap around the entirety of their knowledge bases and expose a unifying gate into their knowledge. Besides making it easy for an outsider to tap into their collective knowledge, this unifying conversational interface might invoke a sense of cooperation between the knowledge workers, due to all of them contributing to a shared goal. Functionality of this unifying conversational interface might be supported by [[Interpersonal backlinking incentivizes collaborative knowledge work|interpersonal backlinking]].

Participants consistently make hand gestures when tasked with memorizing a spatial configuration. Artificially supressing hand gesturing leads to a decrease in performance. Those body movements performed during reasoning accurately reflect the representations being manipulated, especially their relative configuration. Surprisingly, blind people also gesture. This implies that body movement can be used and trained for supporting abstract reasoning.

In monotonic logics, more premises means more conclusions, or at least as many. Monotonic logics have no mechanisms for invalidating previously stated conclusions. However, real-world reasoning is punctuated with reasonable assumptions, which can then be challenged.

The brain-forest metaphor highlights the resilient and distributed nature of the brain. It associates individual neurons with individuals trees which form a forest. Cut down one tree, and the forest will heal and recover. Trees form networks linked by fungi in a similar way neurons are interconnected. Additionally, it's easy to miss the forest for the trees, and focus on replicating individual neurons as the key to creating truly intelligent artifacts, whereas modeling the aggregate dynamics of the forest might be a much more suitable level.

The sensory recruitment hypothesis argues that working memory is based on sustained activity in sensory areas. This theory posits that prefrontal regions are merely in charge of orchestrating working memory at a high level, while sensory areas are tasked with keeping representations active through various coding mechanisms.

A larger oven helps the cook bake more cookies at the same time. Similarly, a GPU with more memory can house more samples at a time being processed.

Some argue that ambiguity promotes creativity. In an ambiguous representation, be it descriptive, depictive, or otherwise, people seem to "see" unusual things. Ambiguous stimuli might force perception into unusual inferences, in an effort to bring coherence to the scene. This view seems consonant with the idea of constraints fostering creativity, because the constraints are embedded in ambiguity.

Mary is a very knowledgeable scientist who lives in a black and white room. The "Mary the scientist" thought experiment asks whether Mary learns something new when she walks outside and experiences color for the first time. This thought experiment questions the relation between cognitive information processing and conscious qualia.

The mind-mind problem refers to the complex relationship between cognition and experience. Jackendoff describes cognition as the computational mind, and experience as the phenomenological mind. He highlights the fact that cognitive science has been progressing in its understanding of the computational mind and the way it relates to the body, yet it has only limited understanding of how the computational mind relates to the phenomenological mind. Moreover, according to Jackendoff, the mind-body problem can be split in two. The computational mind-body problem addresses the mechanisms through which cognition emerges from the body, while the phenomenological mind-body problem addresses the means by which experience emerges from the body.

Consonant with the premotor theory of attention, triggering an eye saccade results in a covert movement of attention. This can be observed through increased discriminative ability for the region in the immediate vicinity of a subsequent saccade target.

A prospective reward associated with a stimuli can boost the detection sensitivity of a person to that stimuli. This can be observed by artificially associating a class of stimuli with a reward and monitoring the deployment of attention to different stimuli. This deployment of spatial attention can even be observed in ERP differences beetween the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres of the rewarded stimuli. Additionally, in the cued reward Stroop paradigm, reward expectation is manipulated before a Stroop interference task. However, with a substraction, neural activity related to reward expectation (CNV) can be extracted.

Younger individuals are often faster in their thought process and more accurate in their decisions compared to their older peers. However, this effect appears skewed by low-performers. Most established cognitive functions appear to decline over time, yet the few associated with accumulated knowledge unsurprisingly increase. Knowledge about cognitive function decline trajectories can inform suitable task choice for elderly to be effectively involved in. The digital symbol substitution task is a paradigm often used in the context of cognitive decline, and it resembles a copy-paste procedure based on a look-up table.

Both representationism in cognitive science and adaptationism in evolutionary biology argue that the individual is evolved for gaining an optimal fit on the environment. Representationism argues that the individual evolved to optimally "recover" physical properties of the environment, while adaptationism argues that it evolved to be optimally adapted to its ecology. However, both of these views seem to be limited, and arguments against them appear eerily analogous. There seems to be a tight mutually-informing loop between the individual environment, picked up as enaction in cognitive science and selectivism in evolutionary biology.

Neuroscience sheds light on rhythms of neural activity and information processing in the brain. These findings are closely related to the timing of various events in the recurring cascade of sensation, perception, attention, and awareness. The rhythms of neural activity appear compatible with the meditative insights into the momentariness of experience, and may provide a neuroscientific basis for it. The momentariness of experience is related to the seemingly fleeting and transient clouds of sensations which form our conscious life.

Some ideologies often seem to be bound, even defined, in terms of their relationship to a certain space or time. For instance, continental philosophy, even if it consists of specific views on specific topics, is defined in terms of its close connection to European philosophers. Similarly, ancient philosophy or physics is defined in terms of the period in which it was pervasive. Memetic spacetime grounding makes it increasingly apparent that memes propagate between localized communities at specific times. Instant communication recently enabled global trends which largely lose their spatial bounds, but are still confined temporally.

Parallel distributed processing (PDP) models have been suggested as a solution to the flaws of centralized symbolic models. The von Neumann bottleneck refers to the extensive time complexity of algorithms forced through a sequential architecture. By attempting to parallelize cognition, PDP enables more efficient models, which often better reflect human performance. Additionally, due to its distributed nature, PDP is more resilient to accidents, malfunctions, or mutations.

Blind people can learn to perceive the visual world through a tactile sense, using a haptic feedback lattice. Many blind-from-birth people also report awareness of intricate spatial sturcture, derived presumably from sound and entire-body movement. Neurons with multimodal receptive fields might play an important role in this adaptation, presumably being exapted for cross-modal processing.

This metaphor describes the human brain as the combination of a monkey brain and a supercomputer. Subcortical structures are anatomically associated with a monkey brain, while the neocortex is associated with a supercomputer. The brain-monkey-supercomputer metaphor highlights the different "attitudes" typically associated with cortical and subcortical structures. Subcortical structures are stereotypically seen as primitive and savage, while the cortical structures are typically seen as sophisticated and elegant.

If the genome of an individual itself places a complex constraint on the evolutionary process, then considering evolution as simply a matter of gaining an optimal fit on an ecological niche is only a limited view. Pleiotropy highlights the complex interactions between an existing genome and the selective pressure it undergoes.

We need to keep track of the objects around us. Dynamic attention helps us perceive objects as continuous across time despite their movements. The first function of dynamic attention is indexing, which consists of noting the existence of discrete objects. The second function of dynamic attention is target tracking, which consists of keeping track of a target during movement. Target tracking in dynamic attention is similar to optic flow in computer vision. An important characteristic of dynamic attention is temporal resolution. Temporal resolution dictates how fine-grained target tracking can be performed. The limited sampling frequency of dynamic attention allows for the aliasing phenomenon.

Barbara Tversky argues that spatial reasoning and the relative representations of physical objects in physical space is the foundation of conceptual thought. But, if the physical space is coded in three dimensions, how can it provide the richness and expressivity for housing concepts? Word embeddings typically span hundreds of dimensions. Perhaps the non-linear distortions associated with perception and motor action are used as high-dimensional building blocks in the constrained space of three dimensions.

The brain doesn't work with words or images directly, but with neurons. This makes it reasonable to assume that descriptive and depictive representations often share neural substrates. Systematic association across the lexical and visual domain further support this claim.

One mechanism through which selective attention is suggested to facilitate perception is signal enhancement. In signal enhancement, attention presumably amplifies the intensity of relevant stimuli, making them appear more bright or loud. Besides subjective reporting, signal enhancement induced by selective attention can be observed in event-related potentials varying in amplitude.

Traditionally, cognitive magnification refers to more brain tissue being allocated to the processing of important aspects of stimuli. However, this magnification can also take place across time. Through a change in the attentional "sampling rate", dynamic attention can induce distortions of subjective time as more information is being processed. Attention-induced time distortions are conceptually similar to periods of overclocking on a CPU.

Place electrodes designed for picking up muscle activity around the articulatory organs, near the neck and the mouth, and record activity while the person is conducting subvocalization. Next, you can train a machine learning model to recognize speech from the weak muscle activity associated with covert speech. Electromyography can enable an intimate channel of interaction with a virtual assistant.

Associating an exemplar with a certain conceptual family for which you also possess a prototype enables you to assume a wide range of properties for the exemplar by default. This might happen by projecting a representation of the prototype onto the exemplar. of Prototypical reasoning is the basis of default logic.

In masked language modeling, a machine learning model is tasked with identifying tokens which are likely to be located at masked locations in a text. This task forces models to learn context-dependent representations of words, which result in powerful sense disambiguation. In other words, those models systematically use neighboring words as hints as to what the original word stands for. In isolation, a word can mean a lot of things. The context collapses words into a much tighter semantic distribution. A similar case of ambiguity in isolation can be found in neuroimaging. Multiple patterns of neural activity can generate the same observed patterns. This is due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of current neuroimaging techniques. However, a masked modeling task may provide the right incentives for a model to derive a specific context-dependent representation of neural activity for use in downstream tasks.

If a person deeply internalizes the belief that great ideas and scientific breakthroughs are created only through the indifferent kinetics of memetic evolution, then that person may be discouraged from ambitious scientific and engineering inquiry. This situation is losely related to the tragedy of commons, as each person is relying on memetic evolution taking place in other hosts for bringing about innovation.

In the context of speculative memetic psychotherapy, the very belief in the scientific plausibility of the methods might be a belief guiding the procedure. In this, memetic engineering resembles placebo medication, whose mere objective is to introduce beliefs, nudging the patient in a certain direction.

Assuming one's ideological mark-up can be viewed as a finite collection of interconnected beliefs, it is possible to make a parallel between the internalization of beliefs and the idea of debt. When internalizing a belief, one is "buying into it" based on coherence with prior beliefs. However, by "buying into" a plethora of mutually-compatible beliefs in a craving for explanatory power, one is essentially getting into debt. The ideological debt parallel highlights the fact that a mutually-reinforced belief structure is especially rigid and inflexible to perturbations. Accumulating ideological debt hurdles the explorative dimension of memetic foraging. This mindset narrowing appears related to [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|rigidity induced by arousal]].

Interestingly enough, an important function of eye movement is not only to consciously direct gaze, but also to keep the visual scene projected on the retina stable. If the same visual scene would move across the retinal image, it would require advanced high-level perceptual processing. This gaze stabilization is the base of the optokinetic nystagmus.

Metaphor can readily be seen as something much more central to thought than a colorful figure of speech in literature. Metaphorical thought helps us find "parallels", not only among concepts, but even between concepts and sensorimotor modalities. The concept of conceptual parallel is itself a metaphor (matching patterns of relation), as is metaphor itself ("carrying over", like a bridge). At the extreme, Hofstadter, Lakoff, and Johnson argue that metaphor based on embodiment is central to child development, abstract reasoning, and everything in between. In their view, cross-domain projection of invariant mental models is key to general intelligence.

Sociologists recognize the fact that in reaction to an important event, it is the extremist responses which surface first. This can be seen through a memetic lens as the most aggressive memes of an ecosystem reacting timely to the presence of a new entity. For less extremist memes, it might take a while for responses to be rationalized, the drift diffusion might be slower.

The debate between realism and idealism in the context of representations can seen as a chicken-egg problem. Who came first, the world or the image? Realism argues that the world informs representations, while idealism argues that representations inform our world. Enaction attempts to solve the world-image problem by arguing that the two are mutually-informing. Enaction argues that cognition is an emergent property of a tight sensorimotor loop which links perception with action. At the extreme, enaction suggests that perception is as much guided by action as premotor intentions as is action guided by perception.

Mindfulness meditation can be seen as more than the process of immersing oneself in experience by attending to various objects of attention. One can also derive value from it through the reflective dimension. Meditation enables one to reflect on the nature of the mind and gain insight into it through a close experiential connection. There have been some objections to self-reflection as a source of knowledge. First, some argue that meditation, as introspection, is unreliable. However, meditators would argue that introspection is thinking about thoughts, while meditation is experiencing thoughts in a state of acute awareness. Second, some argue that the process of attending to experience can change the experience itself. However, meditators argue that mindfulness is simply the process of challenging mindlessness, and it doesn't attempt to manipulate the intentional contents of the mind, merely to observe them.

The neural systems which regulate reward are internal to one's body. There is usually no external injection of dopamine involved in the process of rewarding a behavior. The entire neural apparatus involved in differentially rewarding behaviors is intimately tied to one's own thought process and belief system. Even if some aspects seem to be innately selected for (e.g. food, sex, community), it seems like nurture can significantly modulate the reward system, essentially redefining the optimization function of the individual. As opposed to most machine learning models, the optimization function of biological individuals seems fundamentally malleable.

Despite often co-occuring in human law, responsibility can be disentangled into causal responsibility, moral responsibility, and liability. Causal responsibility refers to the causal link between an agent and the consequences of its actions. Moral responsibility refers to the agent's "blameability". Liability refers to the obligation to compensate damage. In the context of autonomous robots, causal responsibility is straightforward, but moral responsibility and liability are not.

First-order logic introduces individuals (through constants) with attributes (through predicates) to modal logic. First-order modal logic can be split between the ones with constant domain (same individuals across worlds) and the ones with variable domain (different individuals across worlds).

Data augmentation seeks to derive more training samples from data. In contrast, the latent-variable architecture is based on fuzzily influencing hidden states in the latent space during prediction with actual input in order to stochastically generate output alternatives. Those output alternatives can provide a framework for expressing uncertainty in contrastive learning. As opposed to GAN's, the latent-variable architecture uses input from a dataset.

When various pricing plans are introduced for a product or service, more often than not is not to get customers to go for the most expensive ones, but rather to make them more inclined to go with the middle ones. The relative cost contrast makes the middle options appear better options, in comparison. A similar perception modulation based on contrasting instances takes place in [[Context modulates perception of human nature in robots|robotics]]. Additionally, introducing personal tasks with varying levels of difficulty might make it more attractive for the individual to engage in more challenging tasks than usual, due to their relative ease in comparison to the most challenging ones.

Developing meaningful behaviors based on external rewards alone, as opposed to a self-regulating reward mechanism, is not sustainable. Take away the external reward, be it gold stars or social appraisal, and the behavior unsurisingly stops being rewarding, even more so due to the sharp decline in perceived reward. Learning to modulate the internal reward system is counterintuitively rational in this regard.

Stitching together foveal glances makes use of transsaccadic memory. However, the process of connecting sequential gazes operates on a highly conceptual level. Switching lower caps to upper caps in text exactly during saccades goes unnoticed.

The age distributions of researchers making breakthroughs varies from one research field to another. Considering the fact that cognitive functions change differentially with age, one can infer a profile of the cognitive demands involved in a certain research field. For instance, a field with older top researchers may indicate a high demand on accumulated world knowledge and possibly a low demand on working memory.

Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is the paradigm of computing devices being seamlessly integrated into miscellaneous objects, buildings, and appliances which enable frictionless interaction with software. Surprisingly, ubicomp can be seen as the opposite of VR: instead of making the technology the focus of attention, ubicomp is about not getting in the way at all. Ubiquitous computing might form the basis of a new [[World models reflect ideological structures|perception of the world]], one of compute being embedded into the very fabric of reality.

Metabolism influences neural dynamics. During sleep, the body operates on an arguably different metabolism compared to waking. Therefore, neural dynamics are different during sleep. Dreaming may be an evolutionary response to this opportunity of harnessing otherwise unavailable neural dynamics in problem solving and decision making.

Assuming cognition is the result of a tight sensorimotor loop between the percepts and actions of an individual, evolution suggests that the loop still provides an optimal grip on the world through adaptation to ecology. In this way, Darwinism casts enaction in a light of sophisticated realism. However, enaction responds that the plethora of observed adaptations (e.g. various numbers of photoreceptor types), indicates a disconnect between world and images.

Apply defaults in a row, and you get a sequence. When you apply defaults, the in-sets refer to what beliefs you're taking as true in the process. The out-sets refer to what beliefs you can't now be taking as true, given some assumptions you've made. In default logic, processes refer to sequences which are coherent in terms of their in-sets and out-sets.

In default logic, an extension is the result of properly applying a series of defaults. Extensions are defined as coherent sets of beliefs about the world, generated through default reasoning.

High-dimensional space provides increased expressivity for points through complex relationships, more so than simply considering a list of linear axes. However, the manifold hypothesis claims that the high-dimensional space is rarely populated in its entirety, and only houses points across a manifold. This double constraint can be expressed as the fact that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, but less than the (Cartesian) product.

Lamme's model of consciousness and attention suggests that sensory information first enters consciousness and only then enters awareness. In Lamme's view, sensory information which only makes it into consciousness spawns fleeting and transient representations which can be solidified through attention. Lamme argues that the role of attention is to select transient representations formed in consciousness for making them more solid and robust, possibly transferring them to working memory afterwards. On a neuroscientific level, Lamme argues that quirks of the brain, engrained through both nature and nurture, manage to nudge sensory processing into favoring certain contents. The feed-forward sweep (FFS) of information through brain pathways doesn't appear to correlate with awareness, yet the later recurrent processing (RP) does. Through competition, sensory information with the highest relevance to current plans, goals, or actions is eventually selected in executive or mnemonic areas.

A mobile optical apparatus enables an organism to apply high acuity sensing to the whole visual scene in record time. For smaller animals, this happens through head movements, while for larger animals, it happens through actual eye movements.
