contents: How widespread a species is, specifically with respect to other species in its ecological niche, might be indicative of high fitness. A population which mastered its environment, through metabolic, reproductive, and security lens, is likely to be abundant in a given ecological niche. However, this time-bound inference is lacking if one considers long-tail existential risks. Abundance should be taken into consideration together with perseverence.

contents: Traditionally, cognitive magnification refers to more brain tissue being allocated to the processing of important aspects of stimuli. However, this magnification can also take place across time. Through a change in the attentional "sampling rate", dynamic attention can induce distortions of subjective time as more information is being processed, similar to how motor action distorts space perception. Attention-induced time distortions are conceptually similar to periods of overclocking on a CPU.

contents: The body seeks biochemical equilibrium and sustainable resource use. Lack of oxygen, conflicting beliefs, and many other stressors cause anxiety, triggering the drive for regaining homeostasis.
