- robots: You live in a world where human beings are forbidden to work. Every job imaginable has been taken over by robots, even flying airplanes and writing books. You are not allowed to pursue any work-related tasks, just as robots cannot have a life of their own. When both sides realize they want to make a change, they rise up together and rebel against their governments to prove the power of the peopleâ€”and bots.
- space: Interplanetary war has broken out and you're a mercenary who will fight for the highest bidder. Suddenly, news that your childhood sweetheart has been captured and is being tried as a traitor on Earth changes your mind, and you decide to rescue her instead.
